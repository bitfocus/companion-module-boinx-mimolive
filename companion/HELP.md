### Supported button variables

Dynamic variables are generated for all open documents, and can be accessed using a document (layer) indexing scheme. The following variables are available:

- Document name
- Document live status
- Layer name
- Layer active variant name

### Usage

All actions and feedbacks can be targeted using the **API endpoint** provided within mimoLive--see [this page in the manual](https://mimolive.com/manual/5/en/topic/examples-of-api-usage) for details on how to get API endpoints.

Alternatively, **document and layer** actions can be targeted using a document (and layer) index. The first document opened in a session is index 1, the second index 2, and so on. The layer index matches the layer stack within the document, with layer 1 being at the top. For document only actions/feedbacks, just the `<document index>` is needed; for layer actions/feedbacks, the format is `<document index>,<layer index>`

### Limitations

Currently, authenticated connections are not supported, so you will need to have the Remote Control options set to no password.
